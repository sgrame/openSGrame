# Twitter Bootstrap (TB) Zend Framework library

The Twitter Bootstrap (TB) library for Zend Framework adds support for the 
fantastic [Twitter Bootstrap v2](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) HTML5, css
and js library.

The code is based on the [EasyBib](https://github.com/easybib/EasyBib_Form_Decorator) 
library that was created for Twitter Bootstrap v1.


## Build in support

The library currently supports:

### Forms

The library supports the Bootstrap styling for forms.

See [Form example](https://github.com/sgrame/openSGrame/blob/master/application/modules/examples/forms/Bootstrap.php) for example usage.


### Messages

The library extends the FlashMessenger so that it is easy to add messages of 4
types (info, ok, warning, error).

See [Message example](https://github.com/sgrame/openSGrame/blob/master/application/modules/examples/controllers/MessengerController.php) for example usage.
